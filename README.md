# GI-React

Practice utilizing react by completing challenges to gain a better understanding of the foundational skills.

Exercises Overview
VERY EASY: Display Basic Information
Inside the App class render method, return a div with hard-coded basic information (name, number, date of birth, etc.).

EASY: Set Up State
Create a constructor in the App class that takes in props, calls super(props), and initializes this.state to an empty object. Inside this.state, create a person property set to an empty object.

MEDIUM: Use State in Rendering
Replace the hard-coded data in the render method with data fetched from this.state.person in the constructor. Extract this div into a separate component named BasicInfo, passing state into it and importing it into App.

HARD: Display Multiple People's Information
Modify the app to iterate over an array of people's basic information while maintaining the list at the top-level of state. Optionally, add styling to space out each person's information.

Getting Started
To view and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install react dependencies "npm install"
3. Run the server "npm start"

Each exercise builds upon the previous one, focusing on progressively using class components, state management, and component composition in React.
The application is designed to maintain simplicity while demonstrating fundamental concepts of React class components and state handling.
